## Hello Stranger

I wonder what brought you to this neck of the woods. No matter. Now that you are here, we can begin.

Begin what, you ask? It's obvious, isn't it? It's not? Well, why don't you have a look around, I'm sure you will understand soon enough.

What? 

You need guidance? Alright, wait just a moment. I have just the right scroll for this occasion.


_You are given an old scroll that has a few lines scribbled on them. They read_:

- _Artur A. Galstyan, Archmage of Engineering_
- _Loves to write JAX code, usually interested in all things engineering_ 
- _The words "PHP" and "SAP" must never be uttured in my presence_
- _Currently looking to move from the North of Germany to the mountains of Switzerland_
- _Looking for an apprenticeship in Switzerland to further hone my skills_
- _Learning about the black magic of proteins and life_

_You keep reading the scroll, fascinated by this wizard. As he laughs or coughs - you can't really tell the difference - he nods._

Now you understand don't you, he asks.

You do. Time to code.
